== Refactoring

* The SpecI18n::Parser::NaturalLanguage.get(SpecI18n.spec_language) is duplicated in 
some places - check a better way to implement this
* Simplified more and more tests!

== Future

* Translate all matchers
* Translate subjects
* Translate shared examples
* Put a #language header in the spec_helper file (Cucumber Style) instead load from config(maintain the two options)
* Create the directory features to test with Cucumber
* Make the describe/it i18n available from a class 
	
	Example:
	#	class StackSpec < Spec::ExampleGroup
	#     describe Stack, "with no elements"
	#
	#     before
	#       @stack = Stack.new
	#     end
	#
	#     it "should raise on pop" do
	#       lambda{ @stack.pop }.should raise_error
	#     end
	#   end
	
* Check a better way to manipulating the mocks and stubs for i18n (What do you think?)
