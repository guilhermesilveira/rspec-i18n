== Refactoring

* The SpecI18n::Parser::NaturalLanguage.get(SpecI18n.spec_language) is duplicated in 
some places - check a better way to implement this
* Simplified more and more tests!

== Future

* Translate all matchers
* Translate subjects
* Put a #language header in the spec_helper file (Cucumber Style) instead load from config(maintain the two options)
* Create the directory features to test with Cucumber
* Check a better way to manipulating the mocks and stubs for i18n (What do you think?)
