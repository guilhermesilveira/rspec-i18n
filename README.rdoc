= Rspec-i18n

== Description

The Rspec-i18n gem provide a easy way to write specs in any language you
prefer. The Rspec-i18n was created for the purpose of teaching people who are
starting to developing applications but also serves to Production use.
I know that many people prefer to write code/specs in English =)

But if you don't prefer that, you'll like the Rspec-i18n.

== Synopsis
  
Rspec-i18n will supports any language you want
(See http://github.com/tomas-stefano/rspec-i18n/blob/master/lib/spec-i18n/languages.yml file). 
This is Portuguese(Brazil):
    
    require 'spec'
    require 'spec-i18n'

    Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
      
      config.spec_language :pt
      
      ...
    end

    # In spec/pessoa_spec.rb

    require 'spec_helper'
	
    descreva Pessoa do
      antes(:de_cada) do
        @nome = "Tomas"
        @pessoa = Pessoa.new(@nome)
      end

      exemplo "retornar o seu nome" do
        @pessoa.nome.deve == @nome
      end
    end
